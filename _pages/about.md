Welcome!
===============
<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Politics and Public Administration and the Graduate School of Behavioral Sciences (GSBS) at the University of Konstanz. I am a doctoral researcher in the <strong><a href="https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/en/malang0/">Legislatures in International Politics</a></strong> research group led by Dr. Thomas Malang. In Spring 2025, I was a Visiting PhD Scholar at the Department of Government at Harvard University. I am currently a <strong><a href="https://chrhs.watson.brown.edu/people/meray-maddah">Global Fellow at the Center for Human Rights and Humanitarian Studies at Brown University</a></strong> and a former fellow of the <strong><a href="https://www.gesis.org/en/gesis-training/kodaqs-academy">KODAQS Data Quality Academy</a></strong> (GESIS, University of Mannheim, and LMU). </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> My research investigates how national legislators engage with international parliamentary institutions (IPIs) and how these interactions feed back into domestic politics. For example, I examine membership in inter-parliamentary friendship groups, asking whether identity-based factors shape access and representation in hybrid political systems. Furthermore, I analyze how exposure to transnational arenas of descriptive representation may diffuse norms and influence substantive political behavior at home, particularly in anocratic settings. Finally, I explore whether the topic salience expressed in party and political manifestos predicts legislators' selection into committees within IPIs, shedding light on how domestic programmatic priorities translate into transnational institutional arenas. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> While a portion of my research draws on field expertise in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), my broader work is comparative and engages with authoritarian, hybrid, and democratic contexts alike. This mixed-methods approach allows me to link case-based insights with large-N analyses, connecting national-level legislative politics to global patterns of representation and legitimacy. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> I completed my studies at the University of Siena, where my master's thesis focused on the instrumentalization of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) in democratic transitions following the Arab Spring. Prior to my doctoral studies, I was a research assistant in the <a href="https://www.sipri.org/research/conflict-peace-and-security/middle-east-and-north-africa">MENA Programme at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</a> and project manager at the <a href="https://berghof-foundation.org/">Berghof Foundation</a>. </p>
